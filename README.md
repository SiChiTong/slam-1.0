# SMG-SLAM algorithm in C++

This repository includes code that implements the SMG-SLAM algorithm in C++. SMG-SLAM is a simultaneous localization and mapping algorithm for mobile robots. It is based on matching measurements from the sensors of the robot to the existing map in order to update both the position of the robot and the map. This process is also known as registration. It works based on a genetic algorithm. The genetic algorithm finds the optimal position of the robot at each time step based on the given measurements from the sensors.

This code is part of the Pandora mobile rescue robot project (Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki).
